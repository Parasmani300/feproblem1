                    Our problem is set in the planet of Lengaburu…in the distant 
                    distant galaxy of Tara B. After the recent war with neighbouring 
                    planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia 
                    for 15 years. <br />
                    Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find 
                    her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15 
                    years…
